# Railway Foundation Model

A generative dynamic graph model to capture railway systems.


 ## Notes

 - Maybe use an encoder-decoder architecture: The encoder encodes track segments and vehicles. The decoder takes vehicle embedding and current track-embedding as an input and iterates through the track embedding.
